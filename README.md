MorseKOB client &amp; loop interface 'Device-In-A-Box'

This repository is for the hardware and software needed to create a stand-alone MorseKOB client and loop interface unit (device-in-a-box). Sub-projects can be created for different HW/SW implementations - for example: Arduino/Sketch(C/C++), Raspberry-Pi/Python, etc.

The concept is that a 'DIAB' implements both the hardware to run a MorseKOB client connected to the internet and to provide a loop interface for connecting a KOB, or a direct interface for a separate key and sounder.
