MorseKOB client &amp; loop interface 'Device-In-A-Box'

This is the hardware and software needed to create a (small) stand-alone MorseKOB client and loop interface unit (device-in-a-box). Sub-projects can be created for different HW/SW implementations - for example: Arduino/Sketch(C/C++), Raspberry-Pi/Python, etc.

The 'DIAB' implements both the hardware to run a MorseKOB client connected to the internet and to provide a loop interface for connecting a KOB (or separate key and sounder).
