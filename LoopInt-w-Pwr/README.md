# Loop Interface with Power
This is the 'standard' loop interface with power for the loop. The power has three selectable levels. This can be built into a small enclosure to be used with a KOB and computer using an RS-232 serial port, or is can be part of a DIAB.

The loop interface is from a schematic by Les Kerr. The selectable power was incorportated by Ed Silky.
